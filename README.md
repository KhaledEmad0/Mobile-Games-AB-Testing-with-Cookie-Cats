# 🔍 Project Description
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding!
As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase

# 📋 Project Objective
In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

# 🛠️ Skills and Technology
- Data Analysis: Proficient in conducting A/B tests, interpreting bootstrap results, and deriving actionable insights.
- Statistical Modeling: Applied statistical methods to uncover patterns and trends in player behavior.
- Data Visualization: Utilized tools like [mention specific tools if applicable] to present complex data in clear and compelling visualizations.
- Gaming Analytics: In-depth understanding of key gaming metrics, with a focus on player retention and user experience optimization.

# 📊 Conclusion & Results
- Retention Impact:
  - Strong evidence from bootstrap results: 7-day retention higher at level 30 than level 40. 
- Strategic Recommendation:
  - To maintain high 1-day and 7-day retention, avoid moving the gate from level 30 to level 40
